TagMan Customization tips

This repository is dedicated to the code tips and tricks that are usefull to know working with the TagMan tag management system. 
In difference with the Google Tag Manager TagMan does not have a lot of open educational material and sometimes the essential things are kind of difficult to do there, especially to the people not really familiar with this system. 

A little bit later I will provide here the description of TagMan and how it works. But for now I just gonna add some code snippets that allow me to customize the tags and parameters through TagMan without any data layer modification and without any changes on the partners side.

Will be happy to put me in contact here with somebody who knows and love TagMan as I do and will help me to resolve some problems. From my side IÂ´m also opened for new challenges and will be glad to help.
